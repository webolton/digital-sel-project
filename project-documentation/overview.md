# The Digital South English Legendary

## Project Description

The Digital South English Legendary (Digital SEL) is intended as a major scholarly edition of the South English Legendary, a collection of saints' legends written in Middle English (ME) between the middle of the fourteenth century and the middle of the sixteenth. The project aims to produce a digital edition that is designed to facilitate comparison of variant readings of legends that exist in multiple copies.

## Transcription Strategy

Rather than encoding the text with meta data, transcriptions prepared for the Digital SEL take advantage of modern Unicode and use fonts with glyphs to represent medieval abbreviations.

## Sources of Truth

- The transcriptions will be under the manuscripts
- saints-legends will have a list of the MSS they appear in (during development)
